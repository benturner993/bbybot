# Objective

To learn more about LLMs and their application.  

## Status

Currently, the LLM is a Q&A chatbot which has read the underlying Bupa-By-You Policy documentation and can answer questions.  

## Pros

- It can answer: how do I make a claim? who should I call?
- It has been deployed with relative ease.

## Cons

- Data in is always impacting data out. The input PDF is not clear enough - I don't understand the answers.
- I'm not sure about the value-add above existing approaches.  
- It uses only 1 document. It might be beneficial to come up with a MASTER document from which it can Q&A. Answer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXxQ0LR-3Hg  
- The design certainly needs improving. 

## Other use-cases

- The Blog Outline Generator App looks quite useful: https://streamlit.io/generative-ai
- Generate tweets
- Mind map generator: https://ferusandbeyond-mind-map-generation-main-7p68z9.streamlit.app/
- To replicate Finder - or make it smarter?
- Another way might be how it can help us to better collect / aggregate our data. To generate features for models etc.  To generate more data for the data-science teams to consume.
- Using Trust Pilot, this could look like -> scrape market reviews and conduct live feedback analysis to understand what each competitor topic is dealing with: https://www.loom.com/share/d172b487ed1a4b3b858da05df3838574  
- Vector Searching: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzHhZh7F25I https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKQWiqMM4Nk  
- Query the embedding with a question, don't return just the top: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocxq84ocYi0&t=721s keep the index and then return the most similar indexes in original data with a user / company etc. summarise.

## Notes

- There is already a chatbot
- Feels like the USP is an ELI5-tool.
- It does start to solve the problem - how do I make a claim?
