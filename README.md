# Objective

To learn more about LLMs and their application.  

# Status

Currently, the LLM is a Q&A chatbot which has read the underlying Bupa-By-You Policy documentation and can answer questions.  

# Pros

- It can answer: how do I make a claim? who should I call?
- It has been deployed with relative ease.

# Cons

- I'm not sure about the value-add above existing approaches.  
- It uses only 1 document. It might be beneficial to come up with a MASTER document from which it can Q&A.  

# Other use-cases

- The Blog Outline Generator App looks quite useful: https://streamlit.io/generative-ai
- Generate tweets
- Mind map generator: https://ferusandbeyond-mind-map-generation-main-7p68z9.streamlit.app/

# Notes

- There is already a chatbot
- Feels like the USP is an ELI5-tool.
- It does start to solve the problem - how do I make a claim?
